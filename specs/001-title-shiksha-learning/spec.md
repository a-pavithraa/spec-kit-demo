## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
- As a teacher at Shiksha, I want to upload and schedule assignments and exams, so that students receive clear instructions and deadlines.
- As a student, I want to view assignments/exams, submit my work, and receive timely notifications and grades, so I can track my learning and deadlines.
- As an administrator, I want centralized grade management and reporting so I can publish results and maintain records.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a teacher has created an assignment and set a due date, **When** the teacher publishes the assignment, **Then** enrolled students receive an email notification that contains the assignment title, summary, due date, and link to submit.
2. **Given** a student opens an assignment before the due date, **When** they upload a PDF submission, **Then** the system stores the submission, shows a confirmation to the student, and sends an email notification to the teacher.
3. **Given** an exam is scheduled by a teacher, **When** the exam schedule is published, **Then** affected students receive an email notification and the exam appears on their dashboard/calendar.
4. **Given** grading is completed for an assignment, **When** the teacher publishes grades, **Then** students receive an email update and can view their grade and feedback in a centralized gradebook.
5. **Given** a student misses a submission deadline but requests a late submission, **When** the teacher allows it, **Then** the late submission is accepted, timestamped, and marked as late in the gradebook.

### Edge Cases
- System MUST reject non-PDF submission file types and present a clear error message to the user.
- If a student uploads multiple times before the deadline, the system MUST retain a submission history and mark the latest as the active submission (history retained for audit).
- During partial network failures on submission, the client SHOULD attempt retries; if retries fail, the system MUST present a clear failure message and allow reattempt.
- Late submission handling: teachers can accept late submissions; no automatic penalties are applied and the system MUST record a late flag for each late submission.
- If an exam is rescheduled, the system MUST notify students via email and update their calendar entries.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow teachers to create, edit, and publish assignments with title, description, attachments metadata, due date, and visibility scope (class/section).
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow teachers to schedule exams with date/time, allowed duration, and associated instructions.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow students to view assignments and scheduled exams relevant to them via a dashboard/calendar.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow students to submit assessment files (PDF only, max upload size 5 MB) and/or text responses before a deadline; submissions must be stored and timestamped.
- **FR-005**: System MUST notify students automatically by email when assignments or exams are published or updated.
- **FR-006**: System MUST notify teachers by email when students submit assessments.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a centralized gradebook where teachers can enter, publish, and adjust grades and feedback per student and per assessment.
- **FR-008**: System MUST deliver published grades to students by email and maintain a visible history per student.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow administrators to export grades and basic reports (CSV) for distribution.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support role-based access: at minimum Teacher, Student, and Administrator roles with appropriate permissions.
- **FR-011**: System MUST audit key events (assignment published, submission uploaded, grade published) with timestamps and actor identity.
- **FR-012**: System MUST deliver notifications to users via email by default when assignments/exams are published or updated; in-app notifications are supported as an additional channel.
- **FR-013**: System MUST retain submission history and previous grades for auditability for 1 year from the date of the submission/grade, after which records may be archived or deleted according to administrative policy.
- **FR-014**: System MUST authenticate users using email/password credentials; account recovery flows (password reset via email) are required.

*Assumptions and operational notes:*
- Maximum upload size for submissions: 5 MB (platform-enforced).
- No automatic late penalties: late submissions are allowed and will be recorded with a late flag; grades are not automatically reduced for late submissions. Any manual grade adjustments must be applied explicitly by teachers and recorded in the audit trail.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Teacher**: Represents an educator; key attributes: id, name, email, assigned classes/sections, role permissions.
- **Student**: Represents a learner; key attributes: id, name, email, enrolled classes, submissions, grades.
- **Assignment**: Represents a task with attributes: id, title, description, attachments metadata, created_by, created_at, due_date, visibility.
- **Exam**: Represents scheduled evaluation with attributes: id, title, schedule (date/time), duration, instructions, visibility.
- **Submission**: Student's upload with attributes: id, assignment_id, student_id, file metadata, timestamp, submission_status, is_late, history_refs.
- **Grade**: Represents a grade entry with attributes: id, submission_id (or assignment+student), score, feedback, published_at, adjusted_by.
- **Notification**: Represents a notification record: id, recipient_id, type (assignment/exam/grade), channel (email/in-app), sent_at, read_at.

Resolved clarifications (applied):
- Authentication: email/password
- Notification channels: email (default); in-app supported as additional channel
- Allowed submission file types: PDF
- Late submissions: allowed (teachers can accept late submissions and mark accordingly)
- Data retention for submissions and grades: 1 year

Recommendations / remaining operational decisions:
- Maximum upload size (recommend default 20 MB; please confirm)
- Grading scales and late-penalty rules (institution to define; platform supports manual adjustments and late flag)

With the clarifications applied, this spec is ready for stakeholder review and planning.
