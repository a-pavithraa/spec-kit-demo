# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Provide a centralized learning platform for Shiksha tuition center allowing teachers to publish assignments and schedule exams, students to submit PDF assessments (<=5 MB) and receive email notifications, and administrators to manage and export grades. Implementation will use a modular-monolith backend (Spring Boot 3.x + Spring Modulith), a React + TypeScript frontend styled with Tailwind, PostgreSQL on AWS RDS, S3+CloudFront for file storage, Terraform for infra, and JWT-based auth.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.x with Spring Modulith
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot, Spring Modulith, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security (JWT), AWS SDK for S3, Java Mail or AWS SES client
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
**Testing**: JUnit 5, Spring Test, Modulith boundary tests, Contract tests (REST schema validation), Playwright or Cypress for frontend E2E
**Target Platform**: Linux servers (AWS ECS/EKS or EC2), React frontend hosted on S3+CloudFront
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Support initial cohort (estimated 1k active users) with RDS sizing and read replicas added as needed; p95 request latency <300ms for common endpoints (subject to load testing)
**Constraints**: Uploads limited to 5 MB, JWT sessionless auth, data retention 1 year for submissions/grades
**Scale/Scope**: MVP for a single tuition center; design for extraction into services later if needed

**Constitution Check**:
Initial check: PASS

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: backend (modular monolith), frontend, tests (3 project areas) — within limit
- Use framework directly (Spring Boot + Modulith) and avoid unnecessary wrappers

**Architecture**:
- Feature implemented as modules/libraries: `user`, `assignment`, `submission`, `grade`, `notification`.

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- Enforce RED-GREEN-Refactor. Contract tests generated and must fail initially.
- Integration tests will run against a local Postgres or testcontainer in CI.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging (JSON) and basic metrics (request durations) must be included.

**Versioning**:
- Semantic versioning for APIs; breaking changes require migration plan and module-level docs.

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
