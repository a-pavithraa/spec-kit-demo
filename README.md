# Shiksha Learning Platform

This is a demo project to check implementation of **Spec Kit**, a toolkit for Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

## About Spec Kit

Spec Kit is an innovative approach to software development that "flips the script" on traditional methods by making specifications executable rather than just guiding implementation. It enables organizations to focus on product scenarios instead of writing repetitive code through intent-driven development.

### Key Features
- **Executable Specifications**: Transform project specs into working implementations
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverage AI models for specification interpretation
- **Technology Independence**: Support diverse solutions and technology stacks
- **Multi-phase Development**: From 0-to-1 creation to iterative enhancement
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built with enterprise constraints in mind

### Development Philosophy
Spec Kit emphasizes the "what" before the "how" through:
1. **0-to-1 Development**: Generate projects from scratch
2. **Creative Exploration**: Explore diverse technology solutions
3. **Iterative Enhancement**: Modernize and add features to existing systems

This demo showcases how Spec Kit transforms educational platform requirements into a functional learning management system through collaborative AI-assisted development.
